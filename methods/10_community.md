## CSEdWeek
_Use the week of December to bring recruit new students to CS-related communities in the school_
1. **HALLWAYS:** Flood the school hallways with cool CS projects
1. **ROBOTICS LEVERAGE:** Recruit older robotics team members along with any other students in the school to a series of workshops to create hallway displays
1. **HOUR OF CODE:** Every student in the school does a 1-hour activity in class


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* Student attitudes shift to "CS is exciting"
* Students exposed to further opportunities in the school (CS classes & clubs)
* 


#### Rollout Timeline
* How long should this take to implement, come to fruition...
* Significant milestones along the way?
* 2022: T 12/6- M 12/12

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* ( if any... )
