## 09_Collaboration Activity (Joel Bianchi)

# 
## Goal: Intro to Pair Programming
### Lesson Plan: APCSA Some Intro

Group students randomly 
* (See research from P. Liljendahl about ["Visibly Random Groups"](https://peterliljedahl.com/wp-content/uploads/Visibly-Random-Groups.pdf) )

Provide roles for students
"Driver"
"Navigator"

Survey at end about experience with Pair Programming

From https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696 :

```Driver:
  -Write the code according to the navigator's specification
  -Listen intently to the navigators instructions
  -Ask questions wherever there is a lack of clarity
  -Offer alternative solutions if you disagree with the navigator
  -Where there is disagreement, defer to the navigator. If their idea fails, get to failure quickly and move on
  -Make sure code is clean
  -Own the computer / keyboard
  -Ignore larger issues and focus on the task at hand
  -Trust the navigator - ultimately the navigator has the final say in what is written
  -You are writing the code 

Navigator:
  -Dictates the code that is to be written - the 'what'
  -Clearly communicates what code to write
  -Explains 'why' they have chosen the particular solution to this problem
  -Check for syntax / type errors as the Driver drives
  -Be the safety net for the driver
  -Make sure that the driver sticks to the small task at hand
  -Outline and note down high level tasks / issues
  -Ongoing code review
  -Pay attention
  -Wait until the task is complete to bring up design / refactoring issues

Both:
  -Actively take part in programming
  -Aim for optimal flow - avoid trying to be 'right'
  -Embrace your role
  -Intervene if your pair is quiet
  -Know when to give up / steal keyboard
  -Communicate, communicate, COMMUNICATE!
  -Sync up frequently to make sure you are on the same page
  -Don't hog the keyboard
  -High-five every time a test passes
  -Follow best practices for TDD
  -Swap roles frequently```
