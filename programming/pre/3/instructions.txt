Exercise 1  
The point of this exercise is to practice reading code and to make sure that you understand the flow of execution through a program with multiple methods.

What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.
What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)


public static void zoop() {
    baffle();
    System.out.print("You wugga ");
    baffle();
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("No, I ");
    zoop();
    System.out.print("I ");
    baffle();
}

public static void baffle() {
    System.out.print("wug");
    ping();
}

public static void ping() {
    System.out.println(".");
}
