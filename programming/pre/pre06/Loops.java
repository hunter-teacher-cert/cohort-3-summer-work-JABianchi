//Exercise 2
/* Letâ€™s say you are given a number, a, and you want to find its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the answer, x0, and then improve the guess using this formula: x1 =(x0 + a/x0) / 2 
For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with x0 = 6, then x1 = (6 + 9/6) / 2 = 3.75, which is closer. We can repeat the procedure, using x1 to calculate x2, and so on. In this case, x2 = 3.075 and x3 = 3.00091. So it converges quickly on the correct answer.

Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use Math.sqrt.

As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to calculate the absolute value of the difference. */

    double oldGuess = a;

    double err = Math.abs(newGuess - oldGuess);
    //System.out.println(oldGuess + "\t" + newGuess + "\t" + err);
    
    while (err > 0.0001){
      oldGuess = newGuess;
      newGuess =(oldGuess + a/oldGuess) / 2; 
      err = Math.abs(newGuess - oldGuess);
      //System.out.println(oldGuess + "\t" + newGuess + "\t" + err);
