//State of Program first time ping is invoked
The main() method prints "No, I " and then calls the zoop() method.
The zoop() method immediately calls the baffle() method, and we won't return back to it until we complete baffle()
The baffle() method adds "wug" to the console and then calls ping()
The ping() method prints a "." when invoked and moves the printed output to a new line.

"No, I wug."

//Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked
main [ ] --> "No, I"
zoop [ ]
baffle [] --> "wug"
ping[] -->"."


//What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping() method?
baffle() and ping() would call each other in an infinite loop
